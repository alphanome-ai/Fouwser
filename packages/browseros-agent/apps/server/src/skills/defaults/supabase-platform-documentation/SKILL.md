### How to Navigate

1. **Start with `guides/getting-started/`** for setup
2. **For auth:** Browse `guides/auth/`
3. **For database:** Check `guides/database/`
4. **For storage:** See `guides/storage/`
5. **For functions:** Use `guides/functions/`
6. **For realtime:** Check `guides/realtime/`
7. **For AI:** See `guides/ai/`
8. **For errors:** Check `troubleshooting/` and `errorCodes/`

All files are `.mdx` (Markdown + JSX) but readable as plain markdown.
